# What is OpenRTS ?
OpenRTS is a 3D real-time strategy game engine coded in java 1.7, powered by jMonkeyEngine 3 and open-source.

OpenRTS intend to support any kind of common real-time strategy gameplay, design and control, provinding it's own editor and a versatile data structure.

The project also wants to be a pool of RTS ressources, giving access to a large and free-to-use set of maps, models, sounds, armies data and gameplays.

But OpenRTS is under developpement. There is a long way to go and a huge and growing TODO list. We will be glad to receive any of your contributions !

Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjYJWFQFIVE" target="_blank">the engine in action !</a>

# How to set up ?
The project uses Gradle to support any IDE, or none.

Just clone the repository, then run at commandline in rootdirectory "./gradlew run" (or "gradlew.bat run" on windows).

You want to set up in your favorite IDE like jMonkey SDK or Eclipse? Simple ! Please follow <a href="https://github.com/methusalah/OpenRTS/wiki/Set-up-the-project-with-your-favorite-IDE-(Eclipse,-Netbeans,-etc.)" target="_blank">this page</a> of the wiki.

The engine is set by default with a test dataset and some example maps you can load.

- **F1** : Game Mode (static iso camera)
- **F2** : Editor Mode
- **F3** : First Person view (for testing purpose)

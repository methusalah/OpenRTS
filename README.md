# What is OpenRTS?
OpenRTS is a 3D real-time strategy game engine. It's coded in Java 1.8, powered by jMonkeyEngine 3, and is open-source.

OpenRTS intends to support any kind of common real-time strategy gameplay, design and control, providing its own editor and a versatile data structure.

The project also wants to be a pool of RTS resources, giving access to a large and free-to-use set of maps, models, sounds, armies' data, and gameplays.

OpenRTS is still under development. There is a long way to go and a huge and growing <a href="#github-issues-our-todo-list">TODO list</a>. We will be glad to receive any of your contributions!

Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjYJWFQFIVE" target="_blank">the engine in action!</a>

# How to set up?
The project uses Gradle to support any IDE, or none.

Just <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/" target="_blank">clone the repository</a>, then at the command-line in the clone's root directory run "`./gradlew run`" (or "`gradlew.bat run`" on windows).

You want to set up in your favorite IDE like jMonkey SDK or Eclipse? Simple! Please follow <a href="https://github.com/methusalah/OpenRTS/wiki/Set-up-the-project-with-your-favorite-IDE-(Eclipse,-Netbeans,-etc.)" target="_blank">this page</a> of the wiki.

The engine is set by default with a test dataset and some example maps you can load.

- **F1** : Game Mode (static iso camera)
- **F2** : Editor Mode
- **F3** : First Person view (for testing purpose)
